The blog is the main feature of Flaskr, so it makes sense that the blog index will be the main index. However, the endpoint for the index view defined below will be blog.index. Some of the authentication views referred to a plain index endpoint. app.add_url_rule() associates the endpoint name 'index' with the / url so that url_for('index') or url_for('blog.index') will both work, generating the same / URL either way.
